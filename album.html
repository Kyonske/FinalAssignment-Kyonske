                        <h4>1. Aotearoa Sky</h4>
                        <p>We chase the sun to the hills of light,
                            Where the mountains kiss the sky at night,
                            The whispers of the wind call us home,
                            Underneath the stars we roam.</p>
                        <p>Oh, Aotearoa, you're in my veins,
                            Through every storm, through all the rain,
                            From the beaches to the mighty plains,
                            I'll follow you, I'll never change.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>2. Kiwi Dreams</h4>
                        <p>In the middle of the city, I hear the sea,
                            Echoes of the island call back to me,
                            Through the rush, through the noise,
                            I find my peace in the quiet joys.</p>
                        <p>Kiwi dreams, we’re wild and free,
                            We’re chasing sunsets in the southern seas,
                            With a heart that beats in perfect time,
                            We’re the land of dreams,
                            And we’ll always shine.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>3. Tide of Time</h4>
                        <p>The waves roll in with a history untold,
                            Every stone in the sand, a memory bold,
                            From the farthest shores to the island's heart,
                            We’ve been here before, we’ll never depart.</p>
                        <p>Tide of time, take me home,
                            Where the rivers meet the ocean foam,
                            Through the changing winds and the stories we
                            find, I’ll walk this land till the end of time.</p>

                        <h4>4. Whispering Trees</h4>
                        <p>The kauri stands with roots so deep,
                            Whispers of the earth, they never sleep,
                            A song in the breeze, so soft and true,
                            Every leaf tells a story of me and you.</p>
                        <p>Whispering trees, sing me a song,
                            Of the past that lingers, of the future so strong,
                            Through the branches and the sky so wide,
                            I’ll always have you by my side.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>5. Southern Cross</h4>
                        <p>Underneath the Southern Cross, we’ll find,
                            The truth that was buried deep inside,
                            Through the storms and the darkest night,
                            We’ll hold on tight, we’ll find the light.</p>
                        <p>Southern Cross, guide me home,
                            Through the open sea, never alone,
                            With your stars and your guiding light,
                            We’ll make it through the darkest night.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>6. Māori Moon</h4>
                        <p>By the river's edge, the moon is high,
                            A sacred glow in the midnight sky,
                            Tattooed tales in the stars above,
                            A warrior's heart, a mother's love.</p>
                        <p>Māori moon, shine on me,
                            Show me the way to where I’m free,
                            In your glow, I see my soul,
                            Bound to the earth, making me whole.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>7. The Long White Cloud</h4>
                        <p>I’ve been traveling these roads so far,
                            Underneath the same old star,
                            From the north to the southern shore,
                            I’m always searching for something</p>
                        
                        <p>The long white cloud, it calls me home,
                            To the lands where I’m never alone,
                            Through the valleys and the rolling hills,
                            I’ll follow you, you give me chills.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>8. Between the Mountains</h4>
                        <p>The storm is coming over the hills,
                            But I’m not afraid, I’ve got my will,
                            Through the rivers wide and the valleys deep,
                            I’ll find the peace that’s mine to keep.</p>
                        
                        <p>Between the mountains, I’m alive,
                            With the roar of the earth, I thrive,
                            No matter the trials, no matter the fight,
                            I’ll find my way through the darkest night.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>9. Echoes of the Bay</h4>
                        <p>In the rhythm of the waves, we find our tune,
                            Sunset colors painting the moon,
                            Footprints in the sand, washed away,
                            But the echoes of the bay will always stay.</p>
                            
                        <p>Echoes of the bay, hear them sing,
                            A song of freedom that the ocean brings,
                            With every breeze, with every tide,
                            We find our place where the waves collide.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>10. Tāwhirimātea’s Dance</h4>
                        <p>The wind whispers secrets in the night,
                            Tāwhirimātea’s dance in the pale moonlight,
                            Lightning strikes and the thunder roars,
                            Nature’s rhythm shakes the floor.</p>
                        
                        <p>Tāwhirimātea, lead the way,
                            Through the storm and into the day,
                            With your breath and your endless might,
                            We’ll follow your rhythm through the night.</p>
